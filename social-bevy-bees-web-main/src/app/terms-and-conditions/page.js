        </p>

        <h2>24. Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          (a)  <strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> Except as specifically stated herein, any dispute or claim between you and Social Bevy and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or any of their respective members, officers, directors, and employees (all such entities collectively referred to herein as the “Social Bevy Entities”) arising out of, relating in any way to, or in connection with the Terms of Use, the Platform or your use of the Platform, your Personal Information, or any Products or Merchant Offerings (“Dispute(s)”) shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration; except that you may bring a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court. By virtue of this Dispute Agreement (defined below), you and Social Bevy are each giving up the right to go to court and have a Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this Section 24(a) or Section 24(d)). The provisions of this Section 24 shall constitute your and Social Bevy’s written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“Dispute Agreement”). The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to its rules, including, without limitation, the AAA’s Consumer-Arbitration Rules, available at the ADR Consumer site. The arbitrator will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable law and the facts, and issue a reasoned award, if appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at ADR Consumer site, and simultaneously sending a copy of the completed form to the following address: C T Corporation System, 208 S. LaSalle Street, Suite 814, Chicago, IL 60604.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. Social Bevy will reimburse those fees for Disputes totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous. Likewise, Social Bevy will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous. The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request, and/or the arbitrator determines, that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. In addition, you hereby unconditionally agree that (1) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by these Terms of Use and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with the Platform; (2) the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (3) in the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the Dispute, you and the applicable Social Bevy Entity(ies) shall agree to, or a court shall select, another arbitration provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b)  <strong>No Class Action Matters.</strong> We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action and that the arbitrator may award relief (including injunctive relief) only on an individual basis. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c)  <strong>Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial.</strong> If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court: (i) except with respect to a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court, which you shall have the right to bring in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, you and Social Bevy agree that any Dispute may only be instituted in a state or federal court in Cook County, Illinois/Northern District of Illinois; (ii) you and Social Bevy irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for resolution of such Disputes; and (iii) you and Social Bevy agree to waive any right to a trial by jury. You and Social Bevy agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Dispute Agreement and any Disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
          (d)  <strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Dispute Agreement, either party may bring suit in court seeking an injunction or other equitable relief arising out of or relating to the infringement of a party’s intellectual property, or any illegal or intentional act affecting the accessibility, functionality, or the security of the Platform, and/or any illegal or intentional act against your interests or the general business interests of Social Bevy.
        </p>
        <p>
          (e)  <strong>Severability.</strong> With the exception of Section 24(b) above, if any part of this Section 24 is ruled to be unenforceable, then the balance of this Section 24 shall remain in full effect and construed and enforced as if the portion ruled unenforceable were not contained herein. If Section 24(b) above is ruled to be unenforceable, then Section 24(a) shall be deemed unenforceable, but the rest of Section 24 shall remain in full effect.
        </p>

        <h2>25. Additional Disclosures</h2>
        <p>
          No waiver by either you or Social Bevy of any breach or default or failure to exercise any right allowed under these Terms of Use is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default or a waiver or forfeiture of any similar or future rights under our Terms of Use. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall be of no legal force or effect. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of our Terms of Use invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions contained in these Terms of Use, and the remaining portions of our Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect.
