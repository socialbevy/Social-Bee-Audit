        <p>
          Social Bevy may offer discounts, rewards and other offers and benefits to you if you sign up to email and SMS promotional campaigns or other programs. When you sign up for one of these programs, we typically ask you to provide your name and contact information (such as email address and/or telephone number). Because our programs involve the collection of personal information as well as the offering of various benefits, they might be interpreted as providing a “financial incentive” under California law. To the extent that we derive value from the collection of your personal information, that value is directly related to the value to us of the opportunity to promote products and services to you as well as the value of the benefits that you obtain. You may withdraw from participating in a program at any time by contacting us using the designated method described in the terms and conditions that apply to the program, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@socialbevy.com">info@socialbevy.com</a>.
